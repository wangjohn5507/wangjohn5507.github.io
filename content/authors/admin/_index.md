    summary: |
      PET-Select is a PET-agnostic model designed to improve the accuracy of code generation by selecting the most appropriate prompt engineering technique (PET) based on code complexity. It uses contrastive learning to distinguish between simple and complex queries, enabling more effective PET selection. Evaluations show PET-Select improves pass@1 accuracy by up to 1.9% and reduces token usage by 74.8%, optimizing the code generation process across benchmarks.

    summary: |
      TITAN is a novel strategy designed to enhance large language models' (LLMs) performance on task-oriented prompts by using a universal, zero-shot approach. It eliminates the need for task-specific instructions and manual efforts by leveraging step-back and chain-of-thought prompting techniques to refine the code-generation process. In evaluations, TITAN outperforms existing zero-shot methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 8 out of 11 tasks, offering a significant improvement in handling everyday task-oriented prompts.

    summary: |
      Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in code generation, but existing studies focus mainly on research settings, leaving gaps in understanding their real-world utility. An empirical analysis of developer conversations from the DevGPT dataset reveals that LLM-generated code is primarily used for demonstrating concepts or examples rather than as production-ready code. These findings highlight the need for further improvements before LLMs can play a significant role in modern software development.
  - title: 'YTLR: Extracting yeast transcription factor-gene associations from the literature using automated literature readers'
    url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037022003750

    # summary: |
    #   Cells adapt to environmental stresses mainly via transcription reprogramming. Correct transcription control is mediated by the interactions between transcription factors (TF) and their target genes. These TF-gene associations can be probed by chromatin immunoprecipitation techniques and knockout experiments, revealing TF binding (TFB) and regulatory (TFR) evidence, respectively. Nevertheless, most evidence is still fragmentary in the literature and requires tremendous human resources to curate. We developed the first pipeline called YTLR (Yeast Transcription-regulation Literature Reader) to automate TF-gene relation extraction from the literature. YTLR first identifies articles with TFB and TFR information. Then TF-gene binding pairs are extracted from the TFB articles, and TF-gene regulatory associations are recognized from the TFR papers. On gathered test sets, YTLR achieves an AUC value of 98.8% in identifying articles with TFB evidence and AUC = 83.4% in extracting the detailed TF-gene binding pairs. And similarly, YTLR also obtains an AUC value of 98.2% in identifying TFR articles and AUC = 80.4% in extracting the detailed TF-gene regulatory associations. Furthermore, YTLR outperforms previous methods in both tasks. To facilitate researchers in extracting TF-gene transcriptional relations from large-scale queried articles, an automated and easy-to-use software tool based on the YTLR pipeline is constructed. In summary, YTLR aims to provide easier literature pre-screening for curators and help researchers gather yeast TF-gene transcriptional relation conclusions from articles in a high-throughput fashion. The YTLR pipeline software tool can be downloaded at https://github.com/cobisLab/YTLR/.

    # summary: |
    #   It is now known that cap-independent translation initiation facilitated by internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) is vital in selective cellular protein synthesis under stress and different physiological conditions. However, three problems make it hard to understand transcriptome-wide cellular IRES-mediated translation initiation mechanisms: (i) complex interplay between IRESs and other translation initiationâ€“related information, (ii) reliability issue of in silico cellular IRES investigation and (iii) labor-intensive in vivo IRES identification. In this research, we constructed the Human IRES Atlas database for a comprehensive understanding of cellular IRESs in humans. First, currently available and suitable IRES prediction tools (IRESfinder, PatSearch and IRESpy) were used to obtain transcriptome-wide human IRESs. Then, we collected eight genres of translation initiationâ€“related features to help study the potential molecular mechanisms of each of the putative IRESs. Three functional tests (conservation, structural RNAâ€“protein scores and conditional translation efficiency) were devised to evaluate the functionality of the identified putative IRESs. Moreover, an easy-to-use interface and an IRESâ€“translation initiation interaction map for each gene transcript were implemented to help understand the interactions between IRESs and translation initiationâ€“related features. Researchers can easily search/browse an IRES of interest using the web interface and deduce testable mechanism hypotheses of human IRES-driven translation initiation based on the integrated results. In summary, Human IRES Atlas integrates putative IRES elements and translation initiationâ€“related experiments for better usage of these data and deduction of mechanism hypotheses.
