  - title: 'Can ChatGPT Support Developers? An Empirical Evaluation of Large Language Models for Code Generation'
    url: https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11702

    # summary: |
    #   Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable proficiency in code generation, with numerous prior studies showing their promising capabilities in various development scenarios. However, these studies mainly provide evaluations in research settings, which leaves a significant gap in understanding how effectively LLMs can support developers in real-world. To address this, we conducted an empirical analysis of conversations in DevGPT, a dataset collected from developers' conversations with ChatGPT (captured with the Share Link feature on platforms such as GitHub). Our empirical findings indicate that the current practice of using LLM-generated code is typically limited to either demonstrating high-level concepts or providing examples in documentation, rather than to be used as production-ready code. These findings indicate that there is much future work needed to improve LLMs in code generation before they can be integral parts of modern software development.
  - title: 'YTLR: Extracting yeast transcription factor-gene associations from the literature using automated literature readers'

    # summary: |
    #   Cells adapt to environmental stresses mainly via transcription reprogramming. Correct transcription control is mediated by the interactions between transcription factors (TF) and their target genes. These TF-gene associations can be probed by chromatin immunoprecipitation techniques and knockout experiments, revealing TF binding (TFB) and regulatory (TFR) evidence, respectively. Nevertheless, most evidence is still fragmentary in the literature and requires tremendous human resources to curate. We developed the first pipeline called YTLR (Yeast Transcription-regulation Literature Reader) to automate TF-gene relation extraction from the literature. YTLR first identifies articles with TFB and TFR information. Then TF-gene binding pairs are extracted from the TFB articles, and TF-gene regulatory associations are recognized from the TFR papers. On gathered test sets, YTLR achieves an AUC value of 98.8% in identifying articles with TFB evidence and AUC = 83.4% in extracting the detailed TF-gene binding pairs. And similarly, YTLR also obtains an AUC value of 98.2% in identifying TFR articles and AUC = 80.4% in extracting the detailed TF-gene regulatory associations. Furthermore, YTLR outperforms previous methods in both tasks. To facilitate researchers in extracting TF-gene transcriptional relations from large-scale queried articles, an automated and easy-to-use software tool based on the YTLR pipeline is constructed. In summary, YTLR aims to provide easier literature pre-screening for curators and help researchers gather yeast TF-gene transcriptional relation conclusions from articles in a high-throughput fashion. The YTLR pipeline software tool can be downloaded at https://github.com/cobisLab/YTLR/.
  - title: 'Human IRES Atlas: an integrative platform for studying IRES-driven translational regulation in humans'

    # summary: |
    #   It is now known that cap-independent translation initiation facilitated by internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) is vital in selective cellular protein synthesis under stress and different physiological conditions. However, three problems make it hard to understand transcriptome-wide cellular IRES-mediated translation initiation mechanisms: (i) complex interplay between IRESs and other translation initiationâ€“related information, (ii) reliability issue of in silico cellular IRES investigation and (iii) labor-intensive in vivo IRES identification. In this research, we constructed the Human IRES Atlas database for a comprehensive understanding of cellular IRESs in humans. First, currently available and suitable IRES prediction tools (IRESfinder, PatSearch and IRESpy) were used to obtain transcriptome-wide human IRESs. Then, we collected eight genres of translation initiationâ€“related features to help study the potential molecular mechanisms of each of the putative IRESs. Three functional tests (conservation, structural RNAâ€“protein scores and conditional translation efficiency) were devised to evaluate the functionality of the identified putative IRESs. Moreover, an easy-to-use interface and an IRESâ€“translation initiation interaction map for each gene transcript were implemented to help understand the interactions between IRESs and translation initiationâ€“related features. Researchers can easily search/browse an IRES of interest using the web interface and deduce testable mechanism hypotheses of human IRES-driven translation initiation based on the integrated results. In summary, Human IRES Atlas integrates putative IRES elements and translation initiationâ€“related experiments for better usage of these data and deduction of mechanism hypotheses.
